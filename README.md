# 2. Enterovirus Mutation Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline analyzes mutations in enterovirus sequences, offering two modes of analysis: consensus sequence and viral population.

## Input

* **Input file:** `samples-mutations.csv`
    * This file is expected to be generated by the `enterovirus-genotyping.nf` script.
    * It should contain the following columns (without headers):
        * Sample or User directory
        * Protein name (VP1)
        * Path to consensus FASTA file
        * Path to reference FASTA file

## Execution

The pipeline supports two types of mutation analysis:

1.  **Consensus Sequence Analysis:**
    * This mode compares the consensus sequence of the sample to a reference sequence.
    * Command: `nextflow run mutations-nf/main.nf --file <samples-mutations.csv>`

2.  **Viral Population Analysis:**
    * This mode analyzes mutations within the viral population, considering mutation frequency and depth.
    * Command: `nextflow run mutations-nf/main.nf --file <samples-mutations.csv> --viral_population "yes"`
    * This mode requires that the input fastq files are provided.

## Output

Outputs are stored in the `results` directory within each sample/user's directory.

1.  **Consensus Sequence Analysis Output (`mutations_VP1.csv`):**
    * Columns:
        * Sample/User ID
        * Protein
        * Mutation type
        * Amino acid change
        * Amino acid property change
        * Nucleotide mutation

2.  **Viral Population Analysis Output (`mutations_VP1.csv`):**
    * Columns:
        * Sample/User ID
        * Protein
        * Mutation type
        * Amino acid change
        * Amino acid property change
        * Nucleotide mutation
        * Mutation frequency
        * Mutation depth

3.  **Annotated Mutations Output (`Annotated_mutations.csv`):**
    * If mutations are annotated, this separate file will be generated in the `results` directory.
    * This file will contain all the columns from the mutations_VP1.csv file, and will contain two additional columns.
        * Annotated
        * Annotated Mutation.

## Example Commands

* **Consensus Sequence Analysis:**
    ```bash
    nextflow run mutations-nf/main.nf --file samples-mutations.csv
    ```

* **Viral Population Analysis:**
    ```bash
    nextflow run mutations-nf/main.nf --file samples-mutations.csv --viral_population "yes"
    ```

## Notes

* Ensure the `samples-mutations.csv` file is correctly formatted.
* The `Annotated_mutations.csv` file will only be generated if mutation annotation is performed.
* The `--viral_population "yes"` option requires that the fastq files used to create the consensus sequence are available.
